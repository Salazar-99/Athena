## To-Do

Here I keep track of the various projects I'm working on for my cluster

### Prometheus-Grafana Monitoring
- Configure a Service of type LoadBalancer to expose the Grafana dashboard on my local network
- Create a dashboard for cluster resource metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk)
- Create a dashboard for CronJobs (starts, failures, coming up)

### Self Hosting
- Configure the required security measures to be able to host public-facing services on my cluster
