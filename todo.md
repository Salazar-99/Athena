## To-Do

Here I keep track of the various projects I'm working on for my cluster

### Prometheus-Grafana Monitoring
- Create a dashboard for cluster resource metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk)
- Create a dashboard for CronJobs (starts, failures, coming up)

### Self Hosting
- Configure Flux to track personal-website repo for CI/CD
  - TODO: Get help on this: Create ImageUpdateAutomation resource (to update deployment files in git with new image)

## Remote Access to Cluster
- Investigate using a WireGuard VPN to access home network remotely
- Investigate using CloudFlare to allow kubectl securely from a remote network to home cluster
