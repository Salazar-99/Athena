- Create a dashboard for cluster resource metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk)
- Create a dashboard for CronJobs (starts, failures, coming up)

### Self Hosting
- Configure port-forwarding from home router to master node which will serve as a load balancer
- Register for CloudFlare to proxy requests to my cluster
- Deploy personal website on my cluster
